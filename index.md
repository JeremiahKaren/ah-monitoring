# Affordable Housing monitoring

## The problem:
Southwark has a high proportion of social housing managed by housing associations - circa 17,000 according to a [recent Council report.](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s87983/Report%20The%20councils%20relationships%20with%20housing%20associations.pdf)

The majority of these are homes in new-build developments approved by the Council's planning committee and secured under section 106 agreements. According to [Council data](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=4) over 15,000 of these have been approved during the last 15 years alone.

But the Council has no way of knowing if these homes have actually been delivered, because once a development has been approved it relies purely on trust that the developer will deliver them.

Neither does it have a mechanism for ensuring that any social housing which is built is allocated to local families on its housing waiting list.

## Background
As a local group campaigning for new developments in the borough to provide a proportion of affordable housing to meet local housing need. We held the legitimate expectation that when our planning committee approves secures a given number of social rented homes as part of an application for planning consent, then each of those homes will be allocated directly to households on the Council's housing waiting list (currently numbering 13,000 households) - and remain allocated in perpetuity.

Indeed, Southwark's [Affordable Housing Policy](file:///C:/Users/Giuseppe/AppData/Local/Temp/Draft_Affordable_Housing_SPD_2011.pdf) requires this.

The problem is that these policies are not being enforced. Southwark is failing to require section 106 agreements are signed before permission is granted and the result is s106 agreements are failing to secure the affordable housing tenures approved by committee (social rent is often substituted for affordable rent (i.e. up to 80% market rent) and clauses securing provision in perpetuity or nomination rights are missing.

Secondly, Southwark doesn't have any monitoring procedures to ensure that these affordable homes are delivered in the first place or continue to be provided under the tenure secured.

Indeed, through the Council's own internal investigations it admits that while it keeps a [list of the *number* of affordable homes secured](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=4) (15,237 in the past 15 years) - it doesn't keep a list of the *addresses* of these homes or ensure that they have indeed been delivered.

Ombudsman complaint directed Southwark to conduct and audit of its affordable housing secured by section 106 agreements.

The audit

relies entirely upon trust that the developer will comply with the .. - indeed, there is no way for the Council

Why doesn't the Council just rely on the GLA to monitor affordable housing delivery?

The [GLA's monitoring process for its AHP funded homes](https://www.london.gov.uk/file/50558569) monitors only the rent levels at first let.

In Policy H7 of the London Plan, the Mayor requires boroughs to have *clear monitoring processes* to ensure that affordable housing is delivered and remains affordable:

In cases where we have brought breaches to the Council's attention it has taken no enforcement action.

No crossover with the nominations/housing dept.

## Background - how we discovered the problem
In preparing evidence for submission to the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO public inquiry we were investigating Notting Hill Genesis's involvement in Southwark regeneration schemes to date - Silwood estate, Wood Dene estate and the Bermondsey Spa regeneration.

We found that one of the schemes was in the [2014 GLA funding round listed](http://35percent.org/img/GLA+Affordable+Housing+Dataset_v1_0-1.xls) as 'affordable rent' tenure with rents listed as up to 62% of market rent.

We asked a local Councillor to get in touch with the housing association to confirm the rent levels it was charging. Notting Hill Genesis [responded](http://35percent.org/img/nottinghillexchange.pdf) that all of the homes that were supposed to be social rent were being let at affordable rent.

> Dear Cllr Johnson, We don't have any social rented properties here, but our policy forAffordable Rent sets the rent at whichever is the lowest of 80% of marketrent, LHA caps, and our own caps. In the case of this scheme we areaveraging a rent level of 58% of market rent, ranging from 42% for the 3beds to 63% for the 1 beds.

We also checked the Council's [choice-based letting system](https://www.southwarkhomesearch.org.uk/) and found the homes being advertised at rents well above social rent levels.

We were somewhat surprised that there didn't seem to be any control

In the Council's [28 Jan 2016 response](/img/Stage1response28Jan2016.pdf) to our complaint, Southwark's Director of Planning said that _â€˜Southwark Council has appropriate safeguards in place and has not failed in its duties .. therefore your compliant is not upheld"._

It was clear to us that if Southwark did have 'appropriate safeguards' in place then Notting Hill Genesis's tenure switch at Bermondsey Spa would not have occured..

We subsequently contacted Southwark's Cabinet member for Regeneration in an attempt to raise the matter further and in June 2016, we met with him and two senior officers from the planning department. We were assured that the Council had efficient monitoring procedures in place but officers were unable to explain the details of what those monitoring procedures were or how the Bermondsey Spa homes had switched tenure, or the inconsistencies with the GLA data.

We then referred the complaint to the Ombudsman that..

Southwark charges developers a monitoring fee for monitoring ongoing section 106 compliance. To date it has collected $xx million.

Statutory obligations - land charges/conveyancing
Sound evidence base for determining planning policy

## The audit
The Ombudsman required Southwark to conduct an audit

*[DXW report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT128f_3q7of-OJEbyKG4JTfeYw-UTeT8V9ePDyUZlphzJ6aNya2Axpb-BHKSu3KKEhkl9iMegKQsp2/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000#slide=id.g6055a10a04_0_18)*

Southwark acknwoledges that the audit was only partially completed because of



Southwark should apply to the land registry under refXX for the addresses of all properties owned by these housing associations. It would then be able to use the geo-location data (UPRN numbers) to link these properties to their relevant planning consents (Southwark's planning consent data contains geo-locational data).
